In the wake of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the spread of the virus has become crucial in shaping effective mitigation strategies. My project focuses on visualizing the day-by-day progression of COVID-19 cases, providing valuable insights into the confirmed cases, recoveries, and unfortunate fatalities.

Using state-of-the-art data analysis techniques, I have developed an interactive map that showcases the spread of COVID-19 across various countries. The map not only captures the geographical distribution of cases but also presents real-time updates on recovered cases, confirmed infections, and tragic losses. By integrating multiple data sources, including the COVID-19 Data Repository on GitHub, the project ensures that the information provided remains up-to-date.

The project enables users to delve into country-specific statistics, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on a global scale. By exploring the recovered, confirmed, and deceased cases on a country-by-country basis, viewers can track the evolving trends and identify regions that require immediate attention or commendable progress.

The open-source nature of the project ensures that the data set used is publicly accessible, encouraging collaboration and contributing to the collective understanding of the pandemic's global dynamics. Leveraging the constantly updating nature of the data set, the project facilitates the identification of emerging patterns, hotspots, and changes in the virus's behavior over time.

Through this project, I aim to provide a comprehensive and visually compelling resource for individuals, researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals alike. By shedding light on the spread of COVID-19, we can empower decision-makers with vital information to shape effective measures and allocate resources appropriately.
